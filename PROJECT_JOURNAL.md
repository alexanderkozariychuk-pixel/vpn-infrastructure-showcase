# Project Journal

This document logs the key milestones and decisions made during the development of the VPN infrastructure.

---

## 2026-03-29

- **Initial server setup**  
  - VPS (Moldova) provisioned, basic security (SSH keys, UFW).  
  - AmneziaWG installed, configured on UDP/443 with obfuscation (Jc, Jmin, Jmax, H1‑H4).  
  - First client config generated, tested over Wi‑Fi – connection established.

## 2026-03-30

- **Added Xray + 3X‑UI**  
  - Installed 3X‑UI panel, created VLESS+Reality inbound on TCP/443.  
  - Generated client links, tested with Hiddify.

- **Monitoring stack deployed**  
  - Docker compose with Uptime Kuma, Prometheus, Node Exporter, Alertmanager.  
  - Created push script (`check_awg.sh`) for AmneziaWG health, added cron job.

- **Mobile network experiments**  
  - Observed intermittent handshake failures on mobile network.  
  - Discovered that waiting 10–30 seconds or toggling Airplane mode often restores connectivity.  
  - Documented findings in `troubleshooting.md` (dynamic DPI / temporary blacklisting).

## 2026-03-31

- **Prepared public repository**  
  - Cloned private repository without history (`git clone --depth 1`).  
  - Cleaned all sensitive data: replaced IPs with `<VPS_IP>`, keys with `<PRIVATE_KEY>`, tokens with `<BOT_TOKEN>` etc.  
  - Created new public repository on GitHub, pushed cleaned code as first commit.

- **Documentation updates**  
  - Completed `architecture.md` with high‑level diagram, component tables, data flows, security considerations.  
  - Enhanced `troubleshooting.md` with detailed test table, results, and conclusion about dynamic filtering.  
  - Updated `README.md`: removed live status badges (to avoid exposing IP), kept static tech stack icons.

- **Project journal started**  
  - Added this file to track progress and decisions.

  ## 2026-04-01

- **Repository enrichment**  
  - Added configuration examples (`configs/amneziawg/`, `configs/xray/`, `configs/monitoring/`) with placeholders.  
  - Added utility scripts (`scripts/rotate-keys.sh`, `scripts/backup-configs.sh`, `scripts/healthcheck.sh`, `scripts/setup-new-vps.sh`, `scripts/check_awg.sh`, `scripts/install-amneziawg.sh`).  
  - Prepared initial templates for automation (`ansible/`, `terraform/`) – structure created, content to be filled tomorrow.  
  
- **Infrastructure expansion**  
  - Created two additional AmneziaWG clients.  
  - Now total of 6 clients configured and active.

- **Documentation**  
  - Added a **Scripts** section to `README.md` describing all scripts.  
  - Updated `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` with today's work.

## 02.04.2026

- **Created a basic Ansible playbook for installing AmneziaWG**

- **Added project participation and security guidelines**
Created the CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md files to encourage collaboration and responsible disclosure.

- **Stability Experiments**
Run four tests on the entry node in Moldova (service restart, MTU change, temporary firewall blocking, push monitoring).
The results are documented in the troubleshooting.md file.
Key finding: Mobile clients do not automatically reconnect after service restart (requires switching to airplane mode).
Monitoring and recovery from temporary blocking work as expected.

- **Documentation Updates**
Revised the README.md file to reflect planned automation for Aeza (Python API script).
Updated the PROJECT_JOURNAL.md file to reflect current progress.

- **Plan Change**
Terraform/Python integration for Aeza has been postponed until tomorrow. The focus remains on reliability and observability.

### Future Roadmap
- Rent a second VPS in France (Aeza), install AmneziaWG, and establish an exit tunnel (entry → exit).
- Automate full deployment:
  - **VPS lifecycle management**: Write a Python script that interacts with Aeza REST API (create, list, delete VPS). This replaces Terraform for this provider.
  - **Configuration management**: Keep using Ansible playbooks for setting up AmneziaWG, Xray, and monitoring.
- Add a proxy pool for fault tolerance.
- Write a custom metrics exporter for AmneziaWG (handshake age, peer count, traffic).
- Implement CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for automated testing of scripts and playbooks.
- **Learning & portfolio**: Document the process of working with Aeza API, including Python scripting, error handling, and integration with Ansible.
